# angular-seed
This is a seed project for creating apps for WebAPI (or equiv) with Angular, Bootstrap, jQuery and such.
Includes a gulp file that, if you follow the project directory layout builds a dist version of your app as its default task.

# reason
After participating in a couple of pretty heavy angular apps, it became obvious that it's really easy to get lost when it
comes to structuring your projects folders and files. Angular-seed is an attempt at solving this by creating a barebone that you
may use to quickly get on track, not having to write boilerplate code for standard gulp actions and project defaults as well as
giving you a project layout to grow into over time.

# requirements
* node.js and npm
* git
* bower

# installation
* "npm install"
* "bower install"
* "gulp default"
* start a webserver of your favorite flavor and point it to ./dist

# mentions
Dont forget to check out my project[aatom-angular-snippets](https://github.com/simskij/atom-angular-snippets/) which will save you time during development as well.

# fork
I love forks, issues and all that stuff! If you feel that something should be different to what it is today, start an issue or fork the project and send a pull request with your changes. Just remember to write an explanation to why your way rocks (which it probably does)!
